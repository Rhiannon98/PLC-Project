#### THE MARKETING TEAM ####

"As a marketing team member, we want this game to be able to be close to everyone far and wide. We have the belief that most everyone has had one odd experience or another when taking a commute. I am hoping that this web page can be a comic relief for to those experiencing a lot of similar interactions."

"I, as the lead of the marketing team want this to absolutely be all over the web! Without a great team, however, having a fun experience to give to the customers that is rediculously fun, with somehow the obscurity being absolutely relatable. I eventually am wanting to turn this thing into a full feldged game that the kids will rave about!"

#### The Developing Team ####

"I am just here for the ride, but to be able to give the customer and the participant an enjoyable experience is going to be a challenge. There are a few snags in the way that we are operating that have concerned me a bit. But, I am sure that the designer will understand that the logo looks weird so it fits onto the page. I am mostly working on the functionality to allow the player to actually be able to do something and interact with the game that the marketing team want."

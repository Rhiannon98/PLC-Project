#### THE MARKETING TEAM ####

"As a marketing team member, we want this game to be able to be close to everyone far and wide. We have the belief that most everyone has had one odd experience or another when taking a commute. I am hoping that this web page can be a comic relief for to those experiencing a lot of similar interactions."

"I, as the lead of the marketing team want this to absolutely be all over the web! Without a great team, however, having a fun experience to give to the customers that is rediculously fun, with somehow the obscurity being absolutely relatable. I eventually am wanting to turn this thing into a full feldged game that the kids will rave about!"


#### The Developing Team ####

"I am just here for the ride, but to be able to give the customer and the participant an enjoyable experience is going to be a challenge. There are a few snags in the way that we are operating that have concerned me a bit. But, I am sure that the designer will understand that the logo looks weird so it fits onto the page. I am mostly working on the functionality to allow the player to actually be able to do something and interact with the game that the marketing team want."

"As a developer team, we are providing a great experience for our player to enjoy the morning/night commute a bit more. My goal is that there is something that can be relateable when the player begins the game. Maybe even a little friendly competition is not all that bad to keep someone content in their commute. Hopefully there is some functionality and everything will not be broken by the time that this application gets published..."

"Hi! I am a junior developer from a place far away from here! I am looking forward to being able to accomplish and help the designer have their goals be acheived in the over all look that they are wanting their webpage to become. There are some things that I can do in css that other people may not be able to! So my goal is to ensure that the user has a good experience with the web page and that they have a clear understanding about what they are to and not to do as the interact with our game! I am so excited to be with this company after having just come out of school and everything!! I would help more with the javascript but the designer appreciates the look to be a certain away and ....." - sorry, we had to cut this story in order to save time and storage space

"I am on of the lead developers. There are some things that the marketing and design team want that are completely impossible to actively achieve. Which is precisely why I am on this team as well because I have the tendency to get stuff done in a much more productive fashion and being more capable to be able to take my fellow developers and I code from 500 lines of code down to 50 or less. Hopefully they understand the goal of which I am trying to acheive by assigning and delegating the members into smaller teams to be able to get a few new perspectives upon the piece."

" Hello, we are trying to get the developers to imagine what the final product should look like as the project moves along. We are wanting a very visual and decision based on those visuals to also be affected. Eventually, there needs to be a way to encourage and guide the users to go select certain things that may or may not be beneficial to their overall score!"

"Hello there, I am one of the people who was able to watch and test the game before there was a very big launching of it. There are many things that must be done before this product even goes out to be available to all. I test and attempt to break the system that the developers have been working hard on to be funcitonal. I ensure that there are no superficial and severe flaws in the design that could be impacted at launch. Before beginning my testing I do my research about common things not considered when a devloper, or even designer, have come up with as they have gone through this process."

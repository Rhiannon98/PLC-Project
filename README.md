## GamePlay

- On the main page the user enters their name that prompts an alert
- Aknowledging the alert loads the game page
- Player is presented with the default resources and the first question and options are presented
- Player selects an option to continue to next question
- Next question loads on the click event
- Next question is randomly chosen from the array of questions
- Objective of the game is to get from point A to point B
- The player starts with a pre-determined amount of resources 
- All the random events/roadblocks hold a different value of resources either adding or subtracting
- This is achieved by keeping as many resources as possible
- If any of the resources run out, the game is lost
